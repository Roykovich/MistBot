# Mist Bot

We belong to the mist but most important we belong to the memes.

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL9ELlpEAso
#### Description: 
Mist Bot it's just a bot for Discord written in Python using [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and also [Wavelink](https://wavelink.dev/en/v2.6.3/index.html). Its main functionality is to play music using YouTube and Spotify, probably Soundcloud in the future. It has basic functionality as `pause/resume`, `skip`, `fast forward`, `rewind`, `stop`, `shuffle` playlist and `loop`. I did this for my community server because almost all of us loves to listen to music while playing or just to have music in the background. It also has commands that are not music related as `rate`, `roll`, ```choose``` and yet to be added!
